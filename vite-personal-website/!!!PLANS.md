# What I Plan to Do

## Base of the website
* use emotion css in components
* ~~keep a scss "library" that I create and possibly add to~~
* create a theme swapper (in the website) with the ability provided from my library
    * cookie notification and storage system to remember, and then notify the user about their last style change


## Future goals
* use a state management toool (redux?)
* different fonts for theme swapper too?
* backend
    * could maybe serve original site from same backend
    * both running off the same projects.json file, maintainability long term, nice to see the past too
* authentication system
* database
* users interact with eachother
