# Next
* create scss library page 
    * some degree of finilization of this library
* spice up the projects -- this is a portfolio after all, make sure to showcase
* implement page swapper for projects page

## Future
* different fonts for theme swapper too?
* backend
    * could maybe serve original site from same backend
    * both running off the same projects.json file, maintainability long term, nice to see the past too
* authentication system
* database
* users interact with eachother
