# Connor Silloway's Portfolio
## The History of This Portfolio
I made my first basic website in semester one of college (left). I then learned as much as I could about CSS and web design over the following winter break. The result was a vanilla portfolio without the use of a framework seen below.

I used this site for 3 years, until I found myself lacking in a fairly important industry skill: React. I took this as an opportunity to improve my original site as well as expand my framework knowledge beyond Angular. I've learned a lot already and I plan to continue development to improve my abilities.

### The Future of This Portfolio (TO-DOs)
- adjust theme picker for easier copy-paste and correct contrast color
	- consider comma separated rgb #'s for css opacity changes
- add some more _design_ to showcase my CSS skills and front-end abilities
	- photos for projects
	- popup for theme swapper
- implement page swapper for different projects page designs
- small write-up for my SCSS library
- add some personal things (not on projects page)
	- hobbies/interests
	- Spotify API interaction

### Known Issues
- Theme picker console warning:
```js
console.js:288 Over 200 classes were generated for component styled.input with the id of "sc-dmqHEX".
Consider using the attrs method, together with a style object for frequently changed styles.
Example:
  const Component = styled.div.attrs(props => ({
    style: {
      background: props.background,
    },
  }))`width: 100%;`
```

## Connor Silloway's Development Journey
I was first introduced to programming with a summer Scratch boot camp in elementary school. We created simple games and made sprites dance across the screen.

I was hooked.

I poured hours into Scratch and eventually created an [Asteroids-like tag game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/92771985) that I was very proud of. I forced family and friends to play-test, taking suggestions and creating power-ups as it developed.

Later, I took another Scratch class in middle school, yet to escape the odd colorful block structure of "programming" in Scratch that I knew and loved.

Finally, I was introduced to visual basic in High School. That summer I made a clone of a beloved family game called "Shut the Box" for my grandfather.

It was a mess.

There was no win condition, it would freeze up, and you could _maybe_ play once per execution of the game. Not to mention, I didn't know about functions. This lead to the painful spaghetti-like copy pasted code-base that I became familiar with.

I was extremely proud of it.

I recently made [another clone](https://github.com/Cosillow/Shut-the-box) of "Shut the Box" with Pygame

After another programming class in C# and a Computer Science Principles class, I finally knew what I wanted to study in college. Off to RPI I went.
